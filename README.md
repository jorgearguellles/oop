# Object-oriented programming (OOP)

# Progress traking

- [1] Last number class

## Goals

- Understand how objects work in JavaScript.
- Discover the advantages of using OOP.
- Order your code with abstraction and encapsulation.
- Reuse your code with inheritance and polymorphism.

> - Object can be physical or conceptual.
> - Object have properties and methods
>   > Property = object's characteristics
>   > Methods = object's behaviors

## 1. JavaScript Object Oriented

- What is OOP?

To answer the last questions, before we need speak about Paradigms.

When we write code, we can find a problem and resolve it through infinite approach.
When similar approach are resoling the same problem, we can name it Paradigm.
In Programming we have few main paradigm, like:

- Structure Paradigm
- Object Oriented Paradigm
- Functional Paradigm

We need to learn in which work context favors applying one paradigm or another.

- OOP Ventage
  - Order
  - Reuse code
